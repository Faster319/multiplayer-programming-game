# multiplayer-programming-game

In this game, players are tasked to solve a problem (such as those featured on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)) using Python. They must finish their solutions within the time limit, and at the end of each round each solution is scored. The score depends on how fast their code is, how short it is and/or how long the player took to complete it.

This project includes a server and client program. The server program allows the host to manage problems (creating, deleting, scheduling), manage players (kicking, banning), and manage general game settings (time limit, scoring method). The client program allows players to connect to a server to play the game, but it also includes features such as syntax highlighting, auto indentation and custom aesthetic settings.

This was one of my first Java projects so it's not brilliant, but during this project I learned a whole lot more about Java and programming in general.
